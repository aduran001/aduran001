## 🎨 **Adding a Background to Your README**
While GitHub README files don’t support direct background images, you can **host an image** and place it within a **styled section** like this:

```html
<div style="background-image: url('https://your-background-image-url'); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
    <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
</div>
